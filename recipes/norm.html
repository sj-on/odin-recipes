    <h3>description</h3>
    <p>norms come and go and are very easy to create. all you need is some endear-able ideas, a fancy vocabulary
        (that you
        can
        use to bullcrap around without raising any suspicion), and a
        never-ending desire to manipulate the shiz out of people for personal gains.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>coolness</li>
        <li><del>persuasion</del> <ins>deceit and manipulation</ins></li>
        <li>people</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>throw around some cool-sounding ideas.</li>
        <li>convince the majority to join you.</li>
        <li>watch and wait as they public shame the crap out of the minority for not being "cool" or "modern" enough.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>to summarise</h3>
    <p>be a politician basically.</p>
